# zstow
re-implementation of gnu stow in zig, desgined to be cross platform (ie supports windows).
If you are using Mac or linux just use actual gnu stow this implementation likely lacks features / has issues compared to proper stow.

If on windows you must enable developer mode in settings other wise this program does not work
